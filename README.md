#  üë®‚Äçüíª About me

Hello! My name is Jos√© Henrique Villanueva Malavazi, a Computer Science student at the Instituto Mau√° de Tecnologia.  
I have hands-on experience in systems development, with a focus on back-end, working primarily with the Java language and SQL database management systems (DBMS) in academic projects.   
I have also worked as a front-end developer in collaborative projects, being responsible for implementing visual interfaces using HTML and CSS, applying responsive design and accessibility principles.   
In addition to my technical experience, I also served as a Product Owner in an academic project, applying agile methodologies like Scrum and managing the team‚Äôs roadmap via Azure DevOps, which strengthened my leadership and organizational skills in collaborative environments.
